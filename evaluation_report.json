      "generated_answer": "Logging drills, also known as drilling logs, are an important operation in oil and gas operations. Logging during drilling can be performed using wireline tools or mud pulse technology. These logging operations are typically done by Service Companies in an open hole environment, with the Cement Bond Log being the exception, as it's the only log performed in a cased hole environment during the drilling phase. Interpretation of drilling logs can be complicated. Logging while drilling can be an effective technique for progress evaluation. Mud logging is a commonly used service to obtain data from the mud system and drilling parameters.",
