      "generated_answer": "Drilling fluid additives are used to manage viscosity and meet drilling requirements. Viscosity reducers address high viscosity caused by colloids, drill solids, or contaminants, which can lead to increased equivalent circulating density and high pump pressures. Chemical breakers, like mild acids (e.g., Clorox\u00ae), can be used to reduce viscosity generated by polymers, but pilot testing is recommended due to cost. It is advisable to wait 12-18 hours after adding chemical breakers before continuing operations. A viscometer measures plastic viscosity (PV) and yield point (YP) to monitor viscosity.",
