They can be air, natural gas, water, oil, or a combination of liquids with chemicals and additives. A comprehensive mud plan is crucial for efficient drilling.\n\nWater-based mud (WBM) is the most frequently used system, with water as the continuous phase. It may contain oil or air. Fresh water serves as the base fluid when adding chemicals like clays (sodium and calcium montmorillonite, attapulgite), polymers (CMC, HEC), and weight materials (barite, galena). Special additives control properties like fluid loss, viscosity, gel strength, and pH.\n\nA priority for drilling fluids is minimizing formation damage by forming a cake against porous media and ensuring the base fluid is compatible with reservoir fluids.

      "generated_answer": "Drilling fluid additives are used to meet drilling requirements and manage viscosity. \n\n**Viscosity Reducers (Thinners and Dispersants):** These chemicals reduce viscosity by dispersing clay platelets, decreasing interparticle attraction and, in some cases, creating repulsion forces. Examples include lignosulfonates, lignins, and tannins.\n\n**Chemical Breakers:** Mild acids, like Clorox\u00ae, can break down polymer-generated viscosity. Pilot testing is recommended due to cost, and operations should wait 12-18 hours after addition.\n\n**Fluid Loss Agents:** These agents form thin, tough, semipermeable wall cakes to stabilize the hole and protect productive zones by controlling fluid loss.\n\n**Viscosifiers:** Materials like bentonites, attapulgite clays, and sub-bentonites increase viscosity, yield point, and gel strengths by increasing the number of particles and interparticle force.",
